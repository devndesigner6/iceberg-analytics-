# Development Notes

## Project Development Journey

This project was built from scratch as a personal learning exercise to explore the Titanic dataset and practice data science skills.

### My Learning Process
1. **Started with basic data exploration** - loaded the dataset and looked at the structure
2. **Identified data quality issues** - missing values, inconsistent formats
3. **Developed cleaning strategies** - wrote custom functions for different data types
4. **Created new features** - extracted titles, calculated family size, etc.
5. **Built machine learning models** - tested different algorithms and parameters
6. **Documented everything** - created notebooks and reports to share my findings

### Key Insights I Discovered
- Women and children had much higher survival rates
- Passenger class was a strong predictor of survival  
- Family size affected survival chances
- Port of embarkation showed interesting patterns

### Skills I Developed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering techniques
- Machine learning model building
- Data visualization and storytelling
- Writing clean, modular code
- Creating professional documentation

This project represents my personal journey learning data science and machine learning fundamentals.
